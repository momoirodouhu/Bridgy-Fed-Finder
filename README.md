## Installation
At this time, I don't upload the built file. Please compile by yourself.

Since it is based on the [WebExtensions API](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/about-the-webextensions-api/), you may need a [Polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill) when using it in Google Chrome or other Chromium Based.
